## Communism mode for Economic - Event feature update April 10th 2021 plans

Event history with statistics - Similar to AdCap, you can see the history of events you have been in and the date. My expansion and inclusion of this also adds:

* The exact range of the time you played and individual session info + the time zone

* Individual snapshots of your currency and industry at the time

* A trophy count

Trophies can also be converted to gold ore. Every trophy gives you 1-100 pieces of gold ore, and every 10-1000 gold ore can be converted to 1 gold (the amount received and converted will be dependant on a supreme researcher card)

Other features with events:

1. You can convert dark science to science at the end of an event (1 dark science is equal to 0.25 science, so every 4 dark science is equal to 1.00 science)

2. Events can be replayed at any time

3. New events will exist, along with modified recreations of the 6 existing ones.
