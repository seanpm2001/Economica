Adventure Capitalist Mode is a free, libre, and open source game, meant to serve as an alternative to the game AdVenture Capitalist (for when the servers go down, or if you want to play offline, among other reasons) it includes a variety of new features, and events.

For the touch-based operating system equivalent (which is less developed at the moment) see [`/Tappers/Adventure_Capitalist_Mode/`](/Tappers/Adventure_Capitalist_Mode/)

The game has 2 main modes:

- [`Story Mode`](/Clickers/Adventure_Capitalist_Mode/StoryMode/)
- [`Events`](/Clickers/Adventure_Capitalist_Mode/Events/)
